# About project⭐

**Date**: January-June, 2019.   
**Duration**: 3 Weeks.

This project was developted in order to practice with **Java** and **JavaFX**.

There are 3 versions of this project.

Version 1: Displaying by console, basic version that doesn't show/uncover the no mines cells around your choice.

Version 2: Displaying by console, this version has my own algorithm to solve the problem of the previous version. So its a full minesweeper but very difficult to play because is by console.

Version 3: Displaying by JavaFX, graphic version. This version is the last one and it includes the previous version algorithm with the add of the visual part with JavaFX. So its easier to play.

# Technologies💻

* **JAVA**
* **JAVA FX**
* **NetBeans 8.2**

# Setup🔧

If you want only to play just go to preview and click on "You can try it!" download the .jar file and if you have java installed it will run with double click.

In case you want to edit it, well in my case I used NetBeans 8.2 so install it and you will be able to open it without any problem. Remember to clone the project to avoid issues with the project.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Hukex/Minesweeper.git
```
